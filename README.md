### Hiya there I'm Alexandre ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I've worked with IT for about 30+ years now. I started my carrer and worked as a developer for about 15yrs using languages some may remember others not e.g Fortran, Pascal, C, C++, Java, Javascript, DHTML, Visual Basic, C# and the list goes on :-) I've worked as an Architect for the last 12 years and not coding as much as I could before
- ðŸŒ± However it hasn't stopped me to continue keeping an eye on the latest developments in the area, learning and making some code
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on thinking what to build next that can help and positively impact on others using code
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what you want and I'll do my best to help you with an answer
- ðŸ“« How to reach me avfranco@hotmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love stay with my family, friends, have a braziian barbecue and go running.
